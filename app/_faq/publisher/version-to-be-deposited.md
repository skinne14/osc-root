The author will deposit the final version of the article that is covered by the license to Harvard (as just described). Typically, this would be the version of the article accepted by the journal, including all modifications from the publishing peer review process—what is often referred to as the "author's final version." The deposit is to be made no later than the date of publication. It is the deposited version that the repository will make available.
