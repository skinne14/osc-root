The HOPE fund is VERY EXCITING AND FULL OF DOGGOS intended to pay publication fees on scholarly articles by current Harvard authors. HOPE funds are subject to several restrictions based on the works, the fees, the journals, the authors, and the timing. These are described in other entries above, but here's a summary to make them easier to review.

### Restrictions on works
- HOPE only covers publication fees for scholarly articles, not books or other genres of scholarship.
- If the research underlying the article was [funded by a grant or other institution](#grant-funded-research) willing to pay the fee, then HOPE will typically not pay the fee. HOPE will consider exceptions case by case.

### Restrictions on journals and publishers
- The journal publishing the article must meet [certain conditions](#eligible-venues):
  - It must be a _full_ (not _hybrid_) open-access journal.
  - It must make articles open access under a Creative Commons license.
  - It must have publicly available standard article fee schedule, and the fee requested by the Harvard author must conform to that standard fee schedule.
  - It must have a policy to waive or discount its fees in cases of economic hardship.
  - It must be listed in the Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ), unless it's too new for DOAJ eligibility.
- The journal's publisher must be a member of the Open Access Scholarly Publishers Association or adhere to its Code of Conduct.

### Restrictions on authors
- Authors must be current Harvard affiliates (including faculty, administrators, librarians, staff, postdocs, fellows, and students).
- Faculty members and other affiliates covered by one of the Harvard open-access policies must be in [substantial compliance](#oa-compliance) with the relevant open-access policy.
- Authors must sign an [Assistance Authorization](/dash/authorization/) form.
- Authors must have an [ORCID](https://orcid.org/), and include it in their request for funds.

### Restrictions on timing

- Authors must submit their reimbursement requests [within 60 days](#deadline) from receipt and payment of the publisher's invoice for the accepted article. They may request funds before an article is accepted or immediately upon acceptance.

### Restrictions on awards

- HOPE reimburses authors, and does not pay journals or publishers directly. Authors must pay the publication fees first and then seek reimbursement from HOPE. If you have any questions about which fees are reimbursable, please contact the [Office for Scholarly Communication](mailto:osc@harvard.edu). We'd be happy to help.
- Authors may receive up to $3,000 in HOPE funds per person per fiscal year.
  - If an article has co-authors, then each author is responsible for a prorated share of the fee. If a paper has n co-authors, only one of whom is a Harvard affiliate, that author may only request 1/_n_ of the fee. If there are two Harvard co-authors, they may request 2/_n_ of the fee, and so on.

Please contact the [Office for Scholarly Communication](mailto:osc@harvard.edu) if you have any questions about these restrictions or about your own circumstances.
