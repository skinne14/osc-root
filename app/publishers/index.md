In keeping with Harvard University’s mission to create, disseminate, and preserve knowledge, several faculties at Harvard have adopted policies to enable broad access to their scholarly articles.

Under these policies, faculty grant to the University a nonexclusive license in their scholarly articles to enable open-access distribution and use, provided that the articles are not sold for a profit, and they deposit a copy of their articles in [DASH](http://dash.harvard.edu/), Harvard’s open access repository. The policies also permit faculty to obtain a waiver of the policy for any given article.

The text of the policies and further background information are available on this web site.
