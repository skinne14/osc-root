<p><strong>February 26-March 2</strong></p>

<p>Harvard is delighted to be celebrating the fifth annual <a href="http://www.fairuseweek.org/">Fair Use Week</a> this year, an opportunity to bring attention to the “essential limitations and exceptions to copyright” and “balance in copyright law, promoting further progress and accommodating freedom of speech and expression” that fair use (and fair dealing) represent.</p>

<p>Hatched in 2014 at Harvard by Copyright Advisor <a href="https://twitter.com/KyleKCourtney">Kyle K. Courtney</a> as campus-only pilot, Fair Use Week has since become an internationally celebrated event thanks to the generous support from and promotion by the <a href="http://www.arl.org">Association of Research Libraries</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://osc.hul.harvard.edu/">Office for Scholarly Communication</a> invites you to participate in this year’s <a href="https://osc.hul.harvard.edu/programs/copyright/fair-use-week/2018/">Fair Use Week</a> by following the <a href="http://blogs.harvard.edu/copyrightosc/">posts on our blog</a> from national and international fair use guest experts, <a href="http://fairuseweek.tumblr.com">exploring fair use success stories</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/fairuseweek">participating in fair use conversations</a>.</p>

<p>We are delighted to have the opportunity to use this milestone to gather leading fair use scholars and practitioners for a day-long symposium, “<a href="https://5th-anniversary-fair-use-week.eventbrite.com/">Tried and True: Fair Use Tales for the Telling</a>,” at the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Studies, underwritten by the generous support of the Knight Foundation.</p>

<p>We will also deliver a new fair use comic and participate in MIT’s <a href="http://calendar.mit.edu/event/fair_use_week_game_show#.WpDN1RPwbOR">Fair Use Week Gameshow event.</a></p>

<p>As always, our <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/programs/copyright/first-responders">Copyright First Responders</a> will act as official ambassadors of Fair Use Week, donning t-shirts and starting conversations around campus and online. If you have fair use questions, please acquaint yourself with your local CFR. They are always on hand to help you work through fair use analyses (and any other copyright question you may have).</p>

<p>We hope you will join in the upcoming Harvard-based Fair Use Week festivities and read a roundup of the events after the fact. You may also find information on other local and national events listed on the <a href="http://fairuseweek.org/">ARL's Fair Use Week website</a>.</p>
