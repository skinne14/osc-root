As a faculty assistant, you have a key role in the implementation of Harvard's [open access policies]({{site.baseurl}}/policies/). Help your professors [increase their citation count](http://www.openoasis.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=560&Itemid=391) and get the results of their research out to the [millions of people around the world](https://osc.hul.harvard.edu/dash/mydash?v=geomap&t=1&gi=alldash) who read DASH. Hear how it helps people on our [stories page](https://osc.hul.harvard.edu/dash/stories).

## DASH

You can submit your professors' scholarly work to [DASH](http://dash.harvard.edu/), Harvard's open-access repository, using our [quick submit form](https://osc.hul.harvard.edu/dash/quicksubmit). You may also [send the OSC your faculty member's CV](mailto:{{site.email}}?subject=Faculty CV); our Open Access Fellows will then “scrape” the CV for citations and, if possible, submit them to DASH. 

We may ask you to help locate a copy of the preferred version of an article, the [author's final manuscript]({{site.baseurl}}/authors/faq/#final-manuscript): be sure to get a copy, whenever your professors submit a new article to a publisher for consideration. They'll thank you later!

(Before articles can appear in DASH, OSC must have on file an [Assistance Authorization](https://osc.hul.harvard.edu/dash/proxy/webform)&mdash;we may ask for your help in getting your faculty member to submit it.)

## Prior to Publication

You may also assist your professors with the publication process; the [author addendum](https://osc.hul.harvard.edu/dash/addendum-generator) is a way to make a publishing contract consistent with the open-access policy, and some publishers require authors to get a [waiver](https://osc.hul.harvard.edu/dash/authors/waiver/generate) of Harvard's license under the policy.
