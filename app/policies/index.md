In 2008, Harvard's Faculty of Arts & Sciences [voted unanimously]({{site.baseurl}}/policies/fas/) to give the University a nonexclusive, irrevocable right to distribute their scholarly articles for any non-commercial purpose. In the years since, the remaining eight Harvard schools voted similar open-access (OA) policies; as of September 2017, four research centers have joined their number.

In the words of OSC Director Peter Suber, author of [Open Access](http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/hoap/Open_Access_%28the_book%29), "The basic idea of OA is simple: Make research literature available online without price barriers and without most permission barriers."

Scholarly articles provided to the university are stored, preserved, and made freely accessible in digital form in [DASH](http://dash.harvard.edu/), Harvard University Library's open access repository.  The repository has the institution of Harvard standing behind it to ensure its availability, longevity, and functionality.

## Harvard Authors
